# IAcovid19csv

The idea of this repository is to provide Iowa COVID-19 case and death data in
a easy to use csv file. 
The data are reported by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) on a daily
basis and contain information on the county and age group: 
Child (0-17), Adult (18-40),
Middle Age (41-60), Older Adult (61-80), and Elderly (81+). 

Until 14 Apr 2020, IDPH was reporting the data on a website in bullet points 
and these have been replicated in the cases/ and deaths/ directory. 
On 16 Apr 2020, the cumulative cases and deaths up to 14 Apr 2020 data was 
available for a while and this has been recorded in both/20200414.csv. 
Later on 16 Apr 202, the cumulative cases and deaths up to 15 Apr 2020 were
available and have been recorded in both/20200415.csv. Here's hoping IDPH 
stops changing how they present data.
